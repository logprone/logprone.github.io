            Disengagement of society and sadness that comes with aging.

        <p>
            We as humans have some hardwired traits, feeling some sort of acomplishment or joy when we see the progress of the work we are doing, and feeling good when we finish our tasks  or achieve our goals. We get similar emotions going through our head with people we have genuine connections with, our family, friends and loved ones. as we go through life we have multiple cycles of these emotions ready to be felt by us due to something done by us or something done to us or something done for us. When we are born we are surrounded by our family, as we grow old enough to go to school we start to make our own connections with other children we meet in school,in buses to school,and while playing near our house as time passes by we are no longer friends with most of the people that we called friends some time ago, but worry not as time progresses we have new set of friends. This happens all the time sometimes, we are only friends with them because they happen to be in our area of effect, we would not go out of our way to be friends with them but they are there so its on, I also believe this is the most common reason why most peoples friendships end.
