            It has been very long since I have written anything and I would like to make this a habit as there is a perpetual loop I have seen where if people want to write more they read more so that is even better for me. So yes I am writing this just out of purely selfish reasons, my betterment. If along the way I write something cool or fun or interesting that is an added bonus.
